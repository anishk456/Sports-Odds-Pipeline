<h1>Sports Odds Pipeline</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves the creation of a real-time sports betting odds platform utilizing a sports odds API for daily updates. By integrating Apache Kafka for data streaming, users receive timely real-time odds updates. To enhance odds accuracy, the platform incorporates player game history using Apache Spark. The data is securely stored and managed in AWS S3. The project also streamlines data integration and transformation with AWS Crawler and Glue, reducing the need for manual intervention. Furthermore, AWS Athena is utilized to perform data analysis to create actionable insights on sports bets.
